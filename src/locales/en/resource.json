We are very happy that we choose Mad Devs and we are satisfied not only with the result of the work, but with the process itself. These guys are very responsive, understanding and ready to make a couple extra steps to solve our problems, no matter how difficult they were. These guys really enjoy their work!",

  "Review-2 text": "From the first call with Mad Devs CEO, Alla I felt comfortable and trusted her and her team to be able to deliver the functionality and features I set out. We are a very small team based in London UK and we do not have a project manager. Alla and the team stepped in, took ownership and directed the project in the right way. I am sure we will continue our relationship into the future, work in partnership and reap the rewards. When it will be fully completed and delivered, the platform will have a significant impact on teacher workload internationally.",
